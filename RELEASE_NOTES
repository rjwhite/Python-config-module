          just keyword
        - config file  can now specify over-riding 'type' via
            keyword (type) = value(s)
          where type is one of scalar (default), array or hash
        - get_type(), get_separator():

              of incorrectly thinking it is a continuation line indicator
        - added class method set_debug()
        - definitions file now handles continuation lines
        - overhauled handling of debug statements
        - refactoring
        - verify that any type given in both the defs file and the config
          file match.  Error otherwise
        - created sample-program.py
        - updated README.md
