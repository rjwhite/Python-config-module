        - sections and keywords can now include '-' character
        - definitions file can now take a section:keyword besides
          just keyword
        - config file  can now specify over-riding 'type' via
            keyword (type) = value(s)
          where type is one of scalar (default), array or hash
        - get_type(), get_separator():
            - can take section parameter.  Backward compatible
              by only giving (keyword) instead of (section, keyword)
        - handle 'allowed-values' from defs file
        - handle escape character
            - escape separator character
            - double escape character to include escape character in data
            - handling of escape chars in process_file
            - now handles a escaped backslash at the end of a line instead
              of incorrectly thinking it is a continuation line indicator
        - added class method set_debug()
        - definitions file now handles continuation lines
        - overhauled handling of debug statements
        - refactoring
        - verify that any type given in both the defs file and the config
          file match.  Error otherwise
        - created sample-program.py
        - updated README.md
        - created Makefile
        - added LICENSE.txt

        - got rid of get_separator function.  It provided no value.

        - can now accept comments with initial whitespace and not just
          beginning of the line
        - better error checking for hash values - that they really are
          "keyword = value" pairs
        - values in hashes can now have '=' signs in them
        - code refactoring.  simplifying, removing crap
        - the 'main' test program in module much smarter and has real
          options checking (and --help|-h option)
        - added more entries to configs/test-defs.conf so that 
          AcceptUndefinedKeywords does not need to be setting for testing
          of main program in module without the --accept option

3.1     Feb 23, 2018
        - typos fixed in RELEASE-NOTES
        - added files to create a proper Python distribution
          (setup.py, MANIFEST.in, README.txt, INSTALL, ...)
        - Makefile updated to favor setup.py installation
